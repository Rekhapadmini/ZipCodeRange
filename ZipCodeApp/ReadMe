Description: This project is to simplify zipcode range inputs by eliminating overlapping ranges and still retaining the original range.
Assumptions made: input is sent in the form of [12345,34567] [45678,56789] thru command line.
In future, logging can be implemented by using LoggerFactory instead of System.out
In future, the way input is provided can be modified accordingly like having an UI to receive input and a REST controller to pass it on to application logic.
Java classes in this project:
    InvalidInputException.java
    Range.java
    ZipApp.java
    ZipcodeUtility.java
    ZipcodeUtilityTest.java
Driver class is ZipApp.java
